# GW2 WvW Tools
Command line tool for quick checking wvw score in Guild Wars 2

I created this lil script just for weekly wvw summary on [Tyria.in.th](https://tyria.in.th)
There will be more features coming in the future.

## Usage
```
$ php wvwscore.php
```

### View Score by Zone
add option --zone <zone>
```
$ php wvwscore.php --zone na
$ php wvwscore.php --zone eu
```

## Planned
* View Score by Match ID
* Detailed info about maps and objectives
* Victory Scores (after Anet implemented it into API)
* Turn this thing into a PHAR app
